# difference (âˆ’) and symmetric difference (^). These are based on simple Set theory

# Set methods
# Method   |   Description
# add()   |   Adds an element to the set
# clear()   |   Removes all the elements from the set
# copy()   |   Returns a copy of the set
# difference()   |   Returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets
# difference_update()   |   Removes the items in this set that are also included in another, specified set
# discard()   |   Remove the specified item
# intersection()   |   Returns a set, that is the intersection of two other sets
# intersection_update()  |   Removes the items in this set that are not present in other, specified set(s)
# isdisjoint()   |   Returns whether two sets have a intersection or not
# issubset()   |   Returns whether another set contains this set or not
# issuperset()  |   Returns whether this set contains another set or not
# pop()   |   Removes an element from the set
# remove()   |   Removes the specified element
# symmetric_difference()   |   Returns a set with the symmetric differences of two sets
# symmetric_difference_update()  |   inserts the symmetric differences from this set and another
# union()   |   Return a set containing the union of sets
# update()   |   Update the set with the union of this set and others
